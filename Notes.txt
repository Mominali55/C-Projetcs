char *argv[] (An array of character pointers)

char **argv (A pointer to a character pointer)

In the context of a function argument, these two forms are treated by the C compiler as functionally identical.
The reason for this has to do with how C handles arrays when they are passed to functions.

## The Memory Model: Pointer to a Pointer
Let's visualize what argv actually represents in memory. When you run a program from your terminal like this:

./my_shell ls -l

The operating system sets up the arguments in memory before your main function is ever called. Here’s what it looks like:

The Actual Strings: Somewhere in memory, the individual command-line arguments are stored as null-terminated strings.

"my_shell"

"ls"

"-l"

The List of Pointers (The "Vector"): Elsewhere in memory, the OS creates an array of char * pointers.
Each element of this array stores the memory address of the beginning of one of those strings.

argv[0] points to the memory address of "my_shell"

argv[1] points to the memory address of "ls"

argv[2] points to the memory address of "-l"

A final NULL pointer is added to the end to mark the end of the argument list.

The argv Variable Itself: The argv variable in your main function is a single pointer that stores the memory address of the very beginning of that list of pointers.

This is why it's a char **.

A char * is a pointer to a character (which we use to represent a string).

A char ** is a pointer to a char * (a pointer to a string).

So, argv is a pointer that points to the first element of an array, where each element is also a pointer.

## Array [] vs. Pointer * in Function Arguments
This is the final piece of the puzzle. In C, when you pass an array to a function, what you are actually passing is a pointer to the first element of that array. This is a concept known as "array decay".

Because of this rule:

When the compiler sees char *argv[] as a function parameter, it understands it as "a pointer to the first element of an array of char *".
This simplifies to "a pointer to a char *", which is char **.

When the compiler sees char **argv, it understands it directly as "a pointer to a char *".

So, inside the main function, there is no difference. Both notations allow you to access the arguments using array syntax like argv[0], argv[1], etc.

Summary:
You can use either char *argv[] or char **argv. The ** notation is often preferred by experienced C programmers because it more accurately describes 
what is happening at the memory level: you are receiving a single pointer that points to a block of other pointers.
The CS50 version with string argv[] is a helpful simplification to make learning easier, but now you understand the powerful C concepts working underneath.

EXIT_SUCCESS is not a C keyword (like int or for), but a macro. A macro is essentially a pre-defined constant that the compiler replaces with its actual value before compiling the code.

## What It Does: Signaling Success to the Operating System
In simple terms:

return EXIT_SUCCESS; is the standard and most portable way for your main function to tell the operating system (like Linux, Windows, or macOS) that the program finished its job without any errors.

When any program in an operating system finishes, it gives back a number called an exit status code. This code is a signal to whatever process launched your program (like the terminal or a script).

A status code of 0 is the universal convention for SUCCESS.

Any non-zero status code (like 1, 2, -1, etc.) conventionally means there was some kind of FAILURE or error.

### EXIT_SUCCESS vs. return 0;
You might see return 0; used in many places, and on 99.9% of modern systems (including Windows, macOS, and Linux), it does the exact same thing. So why use the macro?

Readability: return EXIT_SUCCESS; is more descriptive. Anyone reading your code immediately understands that this is the successful exit point of the program. It's self-documenting.

Portability: The C standard guarantees that EXIT_SUCCESS will be the correct value for a successful termination on any system that follows the standard. While 0 is almost always the value, using the macro is the technically correct and 100% portable way to write your code. It's considered best practice.

### The Counterpart: EXIT_FAILURE
As you might guess, there is a corresponding macro for failure:

EXIT_FAILURE: This macro is used to signal that the program terminated because of an error. It's guaranteed to be a non-zero value (usually 1).

You saw this in the lsh_read_line function. If malloc fails, the program can't continue, so it exits with a failure status:

-------------
C

if (!buffer) {
  fprintf(stderr, "lsh: allocation error\n");
  exit(EXIT_FAILURE); // Note: exit() is a function that also uses these codes.
}
-------------
### Where Do They Come From?
Both EXIT_SUCCESS and EXIT_FAILURE are defined in the standard library header file, <stdlib.h>. This is why we included it at the top of our file.

### Practical Example: Who Uses This Exit Code?
This is critically important for scripting. Imagine you have a shell script that compiles and then runs your program. You'd want the script to stop if the compilation fails.

Here’s a simple Linux/macOS shell script example:
-------------
Bash

#!/bin/bash

echo "Compiling the shell..."
gcc main.c -o my_shell

# The '$?' variable holds the exit code of the last command
if [ $? -eq 0 ]; then
  echo "Compilation successful. (gcc returned EXIT_SUCCESS)"
  # Now you can run the program
  ./my_shell
else
  echo "Compilation failed! (gcc returned EXIT_FAILURE)"
fi
-------------


The script checks the exit code from the gcc compiler to decide what to do next. Your shell will provide the same capability to other scripts and tools

## 1. char *line; (Why a pointer?)
You're asking why line is a pointer (char *) instead of a simple array (like char line[1024];).

The simple answer is: we don't know how long the user's command will be.

A user could type a short command like ls or a very long one. By declaring char *line;, we create a pointer that can hold the memory address of any string, regardless of its size.

The function lsh_read_line() is designed to:

Dynamically allocate just the right amount of memory on the heap using malloc and realloc.

Return the memory address where the user's input string is stored.

So, line isn't the string itself; it's a variable that points to the string that lsh_read_line() created for us. This is a flexible and efficient way to handle input of unknown size.

## 2. char **args; (Accessing characters or strings?)
This is a great observation. char **args; is not for accessing each character. Instead, it's for holding an array of strings.

Let's break it down again:

char *: A pointer to a character (a string).

char **: A pointer to a char * (a pointer to a string).

The function lsh_split_line() takes the single string from line (e.g., "ls -l /home") and breaks it into pieces. It then creates an array in memory where each element points to one of those pieces.

args points to the beginning of this array.

So:

args points to the start of the array ["ls", "-l", "/home", NULL].

args[0] points to the string "ls".

args[1] points to the string "-l".

args[2] points to the string "/home".

It's a "pointer to a pointer" because it points to an array where each element is also a pointer (to a string).

## 3. int status; (Why bother with status?)
The int status; variable is the control mechanism for the shell's main loop.

Look at the last line: } while (status);. This means "keep looping as long as the status variable is not zero."

The function lsh_execute(args) will be responsible for running the command. It will also be responsible for deciding if the shell should continue running. It will return:

1 (or any non-zero value) if the shell should continue.

0 if the shell should terminate.

For example, when we implement a built-in exit command, the lsh_execute function will see the command is "exit" and will return 0;. This will cause the status variable to become 0, the while (status) condition will become false, and the loop will end, gracefully shutting down your shell.

## 4. *line vs. line = lsh_...();
These are related but used for completely different things.

line: This is the pointer variable itself. Think of it as a box that holds a memory address. When we write line = lsh_read_line();, we are assigning a value (the memory address returned by the function) to this variable. We are filling the box.

*line: The asterisk * here is the dereference operator. It means "go to the address stored in line and get the value that is there." Since line points to a string, *line would give you the very first character of that string.

In this specific code, we don't actually use *line. We pass the pointer line itself to lsh_split_line() because that function needs to know the address of the whole string to work with it.

## 5. Arguments, free(), and Timing
Why pass arguments so early?
This is the logical flow of a shell. It's a simple, repeating sequence:

Read: Get a complete line of input from the user (lsh_read_line).

Parse: Break that line into a command and its arguments (lsh_split_line).

Execute: Run the parsed command (lsh_execute).
The loop performs these three steps in order, over and over. We parse the line into args right after we read it because we need the args to perform the execution step.

Why did we free() the memory?
This is one of the most important concepts in C. The functions lsh_read_line() and lsh_split_line() requested memory from the operating system on the heap using malloc. The OS gives you this memory, but it's your job to give it back when you're done.

free(line);: Gives back the memory that was allocated for the complete input string.

free(args);: Gives back the memory that was allocated for the array of pointers.

If you don't free the memory, your shell will have a memory leak. With every command the user types, your program will consume more and more memory without ever releasing it, eventually causing it to slow down or crash.
We free the memory at the end of the loop because at that point, we are finished with the current command and are about to read the next one.
